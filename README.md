This project is still not finished.
The purpose of the "full_feb.txt" file is solely to determine if February has 29 days.
The header file is intended to create a hash table that stores the months with 30 and 31 days(WIP).
If you encounter warnings related to the use of the `fgets` function, you can add `#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS` at the top , before any `#include` statements.
